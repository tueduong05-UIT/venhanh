## Project Introduction

This project, created for the Introduction to Computer Vision course at UIT - VNUHCM, is a fun take on Google's popular [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) game. The challenge is simple: you sketch an object, and our custom-trained machine learning model tries to guess what you're drawing in real-time!

## Model

The core of the game's intelligence is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This network has been trained on a vast collection of doodle images from the [Doodle Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/doodle-dataset), enabling it to recognize various objects.
